# MonkeyFinder
 dotnet-maui-workshop


Today we will build a .NET MAUI application that will display a list of Monkeys from around the world. We will start by building the business logic backend that pulls down json-encoded data from a RESTful endpoint. We will then leverage .NET MAUI to find the closest monkey to us and also show the monkey on a map. We will also see how to display data in many different ways and then finally fully theme the application.
